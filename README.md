**Steps:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-usage-widget.git
cd claude-usage-widget

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm start

```

The installer will be created in the `dist/` folder.

## Usage

### First Launch

1. Launch the widget
2. Click "Login to Claude" when prompted
3. A browser window will open - login to your Claude.ai account
4. The widget will automatically capture your session
5. Usage data will start displaying immediately

### Widget Controls

- **Drag** - Click and drag the title bar to move the widget
- **Refresh** - Click the refresh icon to update data immediately
- **Minimize** - Click the minus icon to hide to system tray
- **Close** - Click the X to minimize to tray (doesn't exit)

### System Tray Menu

Right-click the tray icon for:
- Show/Hide widget
- Refresh usage data
- Re-login (if session expires)
- Settings (coming soon)
- Exit application

## Understanding the Display

### Current Session
- **Progress Bar** - Shows usage from 0-100%
- **Timer** - Time remaining until 5-hour session resets
- **Color Coding**:
  - Purple: Normal usage (0-74%)
  - Orange: High usage (75-89%)
  - Red: Critical usage (90-100%)

### Weekly Limit
- **Progress Bar** - Shows weekly usage from 0-100%
- **Timer** - Time remaining until weekly reset (Wednesdays 7:00 AM)
- **Same color coding** as session usage

## Configuration

### Auto-start on Windows Boot

1. Press `Win + R`
2. Type `shell:startup` and press Enter
3. Create a shortcut to the widget executable in this folder

### Custom Refresh Interval

Edit `src/renderer/app.js`:
```javascript
const UPDATE_INTERVAL = 5 * 60 * 1000; // Change to your preference (in milliseconds)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Login Required" keeps appearing
- Your Claude.ai session may have expired
- Click "Login to Claude" to re-authenticate
- Check that you're logging into the correct account

### Widget not updating
- Check your internet connection
- Click the refresh button manually
- Ensure Claude.ai is accessible in your region
- Try re-logging in from the system tray menu

### Widget position not saving
- Window position is now saved automatically when you drag it
- Position will be restored when you restart the app

### Build errors
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## Privacy & Security

- Your session credentials are stored **locally only** using encrypted storage
- No data is sent to any third-party servers
- The widget only communicates with Claude.ai official API
- Session cookies are stored using Electron's secure storage
- **Logout** completely removes the session key from encrypted storage, clears all Claude.ai cookies, and wipes Electron session storage (localStorage, sessionStorage, cacheStorage) so nothing lingers on shared machines

### Session Key Storage Details

The `sessionKey` (a bearer token for Claude.ai) is stored in two places:

| Location | Purpose | Cleared on logout? |
|---|---|---|
| `%APPDATA%/claude-usage-widget/config.json` (encrypted via `electron-store`) | Persists credentials between app restarts | Yes |
| Electron in-memory session cookie (`.claude.ai` domain, `secure`, `httpOnly`) | Used by hidden BrowserWindow for API requests | Yes |

The encryption key is embedded in the application. This protects against casual file inspection but not against a determined attacker with access to the source code. For shared machines, always log out when finished.

## Technical Details

**Built with:**
- Electron 28.0.0
- Pure JavaScript (no framework overhead)
- Native Node.js APIs
- electron-store for secure storage

**API Endpoint:**
```
https://claude.ai/api/organizations/{org_id}/usage
```

**Storage Location:**
```
%APPDATA%/claude-usage-widget/config.json (encrypted)
```

**Debug Mode:**

To enable verbose logging, run with the `--debug` flag or set the `DEBUG_LOG=1` environment variable:
```bash
# Via flag
electron . --debug

# Via env var
DEBUG_LOG=1 npm start
```
